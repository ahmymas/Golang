Today I installed Ubuntu 20.04 on my laptop using VirtualBox. I could not installed dual boot, I don't even now why(maybe it is because of my laptop). So, I decided to try other methods. I searched these methods from Google It seems a bit harder for me first, but I completed this task succesfully!
I also opened new repository in Github which is called Golang(I found a video from YouTube, that explained how to create and use repositories). You can check it in my profile. (https://github.com/ahmymas)
After that, I learnt some basic commands in terminal. I feel so bored when my terminal is not allowing me to input my password. Eventually, I found answer for this problem from GOOGLE again. :)
I tried to "git clone (my repository)" in terminal. Then, cloning finished succesfully! After that, I typed ls in order to access files inside of it.
These were all I wanted to tell you today
Tomorrow, I am going to install Golang. I think I will learn it from YouTube.
